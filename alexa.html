                    <p>
                        This month, you and I had our first interaction 
                        through a cute invitation to play CODM. Throughout 
                        the month, our relationship didn't progress much, as 
                        I could sense that both of us were testing the waters. 
                        However, there was a playful undertone in our conversations, 
                        with hints of teasing and joking between us.
                        <br><br>
                        Since we started talking toward the end of the month, 
                        we frequently found ourselves asking about each other's daily 
                        lives. This included the numerous times we played 
                        CODM together. Despite the cautious approach we took, 
                        there was an unspoken connection building through our 
                        shared interests and the lighthearted banter we exchanged.

                    <p>
                        In this month, there haven't been too many 
                        conflicts because, again, we're still testing 
                        the waters. During this time, there came a point 
                        where it seemed like we stopped talking because you
                        mentioned that there's a part of you that's not yet 
                        ready or is still confused about certain things.

                    <p>
                        This month, I admit that I was also confused 
                        about my feelings. I was afraid of falling for you 
                        during this time, but I also confessed to you that
                        I have a clear intentions toward you. I can say that 
                        this month is extra special for us, especially for me.

                        When I recall this month, it makes me laugh at the way 
                        I confessed to you. Especially since it's your birthday 
                        month, this is also the month when I asked if I could 
                        court you. Sadly, I remember that during this month, 
                        you had a serious breakdown because you suddenly got sick. 
                        I love you always, baby !!!

                        I love your childish side, my love. Don't ever change, 
                        I can endure staying with that attitude of yours.

                        This might be the most painful month for me regarding 
                        our relationship, but I learned a lot this month. 
                        I just kept understanding you more and learning how to love 
                        you even more. Thank you for staying, my love.

                        Like other lovers, our fights became more frequent 
                        each month. But again, nothing changed in my feelings 
                        for you. You are still the one I choose for
                        the future. I celebrated my Christmas last year with you, 
                        and hopefully, there will be more years to come 
                        celebrating Christmas together.

                        We welcomed the new year together, 
                        but similar to what happened in November, 
                        it repeated this month. I thought there was 
                        no hope for us to return to how we were. 
                        It's beautiful to think that we still went home 
                        to each other, and I appreciate you always for choosing me, 
                        baby.

                        So, I'm asking you right now if I can date you
